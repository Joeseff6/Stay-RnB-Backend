# Project 3 - rough draft proposal

## Title: Stay-RnB (room and boarding)


## Overview

This project will be our full stack mobile application using React and Expo/React Native to build our application for iOS and Android. 


## User story

Let's say you're moving into a new place or area and you don't need a full apartment or house for rent/own. You're starting off with little budget and can't afford a whole place. Our app will connect you with people that will have a rooms for share that may be over half of the cost for a whole apartment or house. You will be able to see what places are available with rooms for share by the zip code. These rooms for long term stays at least 6 months or longer. 

Motivation came from a time when I really needed another place but I don't need the whole apartment or house to stay and it was really hard to find places that can offer room sharing services.
